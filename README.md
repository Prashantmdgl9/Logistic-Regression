# Logistic-Regression
80% of the problems that we deal in predictive analytics are of classification in nature i.e. the target variable is categorical in nature. Logistic regression is one of the most used algorithm in field of analytics. Random forests, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting have their own quirks and their strengths but the starting point most of the times is logistic regression that gives us a scale of the performance. It doesn’t contain the regularization parameters that are included in tree based methods that can reduce the bias variance errors but then too it gives good estimate of the error and can act as a base for further research. As a general rule, it is advisable to use logistic regression with cross validation that can reduce the error in the predictions. Logistic regression is still relevant in age of machine learning because the solutions that are provided by machine learning might not fit the business case scenarios. ML’s predictive efficiency comes with complexity in the model and we keep on combining variables to make models stronger which might make no sense in business.
